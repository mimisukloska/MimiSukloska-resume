        <br>I am currently a Pre-Business student planning to concentrate in finance. I am interested in Finance because I want to get a full understanding on the processess of making a business successful. I believe finance is the foundation to a successful business and I am interested in gaining knowledge and experience. However, after getting my Bachelor's Degree in Finance, I plan on attending Law School. I want to attend law school because I am passionate about social justice reform. As an immigrant, I understand first hand how difficult it is to get a grasp on life in the U.S. and to fully emerse oneself in it when not all of the opportunities are available. I want to go to law school and be the help that many immigrants in this nation are seeking for. 
          Currently, as a college freshman, I don't have much work experience, however I am eager to gain some. Work experience that I do have however, is being employed at In-n-Out Burger since April 2019. Having this job has helped me built a foundation for my communication skillset. It has taught me customer service skills that I will continue to utilize in the future as I have had the opportunities to deal with every type of cusotmer. It has also gave me great multitasking collaborate team work skills, as me and the rest of the associates were always working as a team. No one task was completed alone, and everyone had to quickly get their portion done, while still making the food with quality, and quickly pass along the task to the next person. This job has taught me a lot that will be very beneficial to me in my professional career, as I can now navigate my way with communicating, whether it may be to co-workers or customers, and it has earned me a great skillset in collaboration and multitasking.
            In addition to being an In-N-Out associate, I hold a position in my organization. I am my organization's Event Chairman, meaning every event is planned by me and all the documentation. A few examples of the work I do for this organization would be, making sure that we have every necessary Cedrtificate of Insurance, making sure all agreements are signed by each party, communicating with my event planner on a daily basis abouta tasks that still need to be complete, as well as relaying this back to my organization. In addition, I am responsible for rationign up my budget into differnt portions and making sure that I have money leftover after all expenses are paid for. I believe that this is a very rewarding position, as I have gained so much knowledge in how mucgh work truly goes into planning events and making sure everything runs smoothly. These are skills that may be useful to me in the future for a job or internship if I know how to execute projects precisely.<br>
